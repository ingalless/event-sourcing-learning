# Event Sourcing Learning

Inspired by [this talk](https://youtu.be/STKCRSUsyP0?si=wLMm5UGnaxxTa4Dp&t=1251) and [this article](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)by Martin Fowler I decided to try implement event sourcing in a project. I would also like to take a look at [simulation testing](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/about/vopr) as I found [TigerBeetle's presentation](https://youtu.be/sC1B3d9C_sI?si=7oNr40_LqDNnpr_-) presentation on the subject mesmerizing.

## Running
